**# Support Intelligence Copilot**

**## AI-Native Decision Support for Revenue-Aware Customer Operations**

Support Intelligence Copilot is an AI-powered decision-support prototype that analyzes customer support tickets to identify escalation risk, churn intent, and revenue impact signals.

This project demonstrates how LLMs can augment operational workflows and transform support from reactive case handling into proactive revenue protection.

Built using Lovable for rapid prototyping, the goal was to validate product hypotheses, workflow feasibility, and AI-assisted UX before full-scale production development.

**## Problem Statement**

In modern B2B SaaS environments, churn signals often first appear in support conversations.

Escalations strongly correlate with renewal risk and revenue impact.

Executive dissatisfaction is often subtle but embedded in language patterns.

Manual triage creates inconsistent risk assessment and delayed escalation handling.

Most support systems treat tickets as operational tasks rather than revenue intelligence signals.

**## Product Vision**

Shift support intake from “Resolve this issue” to “Assess risk, protect revenue, and respond intelligently.”

The Copilot acts as an AI intelligence layer between raw customer communication and high-stakes operational decision-making.

**## Core Capabilities**

Classifies issue categories and detects urgency markers.

Flags renewal timing references and vendor-switching language.

Identifies revenue-impact indicators and executive-level risk signals.

Generates structured next-best action recommendations.

Drafts professional, executive-ready responses.

**The objective is decision intelligence — not simple automation.**

**## Why This Is a Prototype**

**This application was intentionally built using AI-assisted rapid development tools to validate the product hypothesis quickly.**

**The focus was speed-to-validation, workflow experimentation, and measurable impact simulation — not production-grade infrastructure.**

**In a full implementation, this system would integrate with CRM, support platforms, and renewal databases for real-time revenue-aware analysis.**
