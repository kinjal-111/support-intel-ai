Support Intelligence Copilot
AI-Native Decision Support for Revenue-Aware Customer Operations
Executive Summary

Support Intelligence Copilot is an AI-powered decision-support prototype that analyzes unstructured customer support tickets to identify escalation risk, churn intent, and revenue impact signals.

Instead of simply automating responses, this system augments support teams with structured AI-driven intelligence, enabling proactive decision-making and revenue protection.

This prototype was built using Lovable (AI-assisted rapid prototyping) to validate workflow feasibility, UX design, and business impact hypotheses before production investment.

Problem Statement

In B2B SaaS environments:

Churn signals often appear first in support conversations

Escalations strongly correlate with renewal risk

Executive dissatisfaction is subtle but detectable in language

Manual triage creates inconsistent risk assessment

However, most support systems treat tickets as operational tasks — not as revenue intelligence signals.

Product Vision

Shift support intake from:

“Resolve this issue.”

To:

“Assess risk, protect revenue, and respond intelligently.”

The Copilot acts as an AI intelligence layer between raw customer communication and operational decision-making.

Core Capabilities

The system uses LLM-powered analysis to:

Classify issue category

Detect sentiment and urgency markers

Identify renewal timing references

Flag vendor-switching language

Extract revenue-impact mentions

Generate next-best action recommendations

Draft executive-ready responses

The goal is structured decision intelligence — not just text generation.

Core Hypothesis

If support teams receive AI-generated risk intelligence at ticket intake, then:

Triage time will decrease

Escalations can be proactively managed

Churn signals will surface earlier

Cross-functional visibility will improve

Revenue leakage risk will decrease

This prototype tests behavioral augmentation over automation replacement.

Why Built Using Lovable

This project was intentionally developed as a rapid AI prototype to:

Validate product-market fit assumptions quickly

Explore AI-assisted workflow design

Simulate measurable KPI impact

Demonstrate feasibility without heavy infrastructure

The objective was speed-to-validation, not production-grade engineering.

In a production environment, this system would integrate with:

Salesforce Service Cloud

Zendesk

Gainsight

CRM ARR and renewal databases

Historical ticket datasets for model tuning

Future Enhancements

Account-level longitudinal risk modeling

Predictive renewal scoring

Escalation probability training on historical data

AI-based auto-routing based on revenue tier

Manager dashboard for trend analysis

Why This Demonstrates AI PM Capability

This project reflects:

Clear enterprise problem framing

Strategic AI opportunity identification

Defined success metrics

Hypothesis-driven validation

Practical understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations

Revenue-aligned product thinking

It demonstrates the ability to design AI-native workflows tied directly to measurable business outcomes.
